I like to build platforms -- whether they are software platforms, collaboration hubs, or systems that orchestrate human-machine interactions. I believe building platforms is about creating connections between software, hardware, and minds.  Platforms have the power of organization, generating re-usable components to viability and fast-react production. They make us more productive, drive organizations toward greater efficiency, and elevate society. 

My overarching research question is: 

>> How can we design platforms that orchestrate human-machine interactions to achieve collective cognition, surpassing the capabilities of individual agents?

This question drives my exploration into the development of systems where humans and machines work together seamlessly, creating outcomes greater than the sum of their parts. I am convinced that these are the building blocks of the innovative platforms that will fuel tomorrowâ€™s society.

In this scope, my research interest falls in the intersection between: 
* [**Generative Intelligence**](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/generative-intelligence-systems-concepts-and-research-opportunities-0740b1b5c7eb), exploring AI systems that autonomously create new content or solutions, emulating human creativity and innovation.
* [**Collaborative Intelligence**](https://medium.com/generative-intelligence-lab/collective-intelligence-concepts-and-research-opportunities-6130ef044114), investigating how groups of agents, whether human or artificial, can work together to solve complex problems more efficiently than individuals.
* **Multi-Agent Systems**, examining the interactions, collaborations, and competition between multiple autonomous agents in shared environments to achieve complex objectives.
