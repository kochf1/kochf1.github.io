# My Philosophy on Academic Advisory


Thank you for considering me as your academic advisor.

My role is to help researchers think strategically, publish effectively, innovate meaningfully, and most importantly, **conduct research that matters**. In order to create academic success, we must focus on real problems, pursue rigorous inquiry, and deliver tangible results. My advise follows four steps:

* [Step 1: Start Strong](#star-strong)
* [Step 2: Deliver Results](#deliver-results)
* [Step 3: Fulfill Expectations](#fulfill-expectations)
* [Step 4: Reap the Rewards](#reap-the-rewards)

## Start Strong

Look, research is not easy! You have to be really committed and *passionate about the problem*, and even then it won't be a walk in the park. People will be asking: *what is your research about*? There is no better way to answer that question than:

> **Define an Intriguing Research Question**

This should be a problem that is not only intellectually challenging and personally meaningful. 

Once youâ€™ve found that problem, the next step is to:

> **Write your Research Proposal**

Your proposal should be short, **free of buzzwords**, and convincing. 

**Research Proposal**
* My Intriguing Research Question
* My Arguments:
    * Why does this problem exist?
    * What is currently already there?
    * What is missing to address the problem?
    * How I will address the problem?
    * What will the impact be?
* My Plan of Action:
    * What will I be doing during the program?
    * What are the **results that I will be delivering**? When?
    * What resources do I need to execute this program?


## Deliver Results

Notice the key question highlighted in the description above ðŸ‘†.

That is: delivering results is essential. Especially in a non-financially bonding commitment like the advisor-pupil relationship, commitment and results are core expectations.

In the scope of a research program, we are talking about **relevant scholarly outcomes** such as:
* **Publications**.
* **Experiments and Results** to support better Publications.
* **Research Frameworks** to support these Experiments.
* **Projects** to structure these Research Frameworks.
* Intellectual Property.
* Grant proposals.

At this point, you should stop and think: "is that what I want?"

Because, really, if in your mind crossed this thought: "I am not the publication kind of gal/guy?", and you didnâ€™t reconsider that thought afterward.  Then, maybe Academic Research is not for you. Or I am not your Advisor. Be honest here!

**Publications** are key metrics in any academic research program. Papers that matter must be worth reading, exploring relevant aspects of the intriguing question you formulated above. Ideally, these publications should target venues that contribute to the University's or Department's performance metrics â€” such as those listed in [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org) and other rankings. When that happens, your publications become a win-win for everyone!

## Fulfill Expectations

You must come expecting a lot from me, as your Advisor! That is OK, and I promise that I will put the effort to fulfill that expectation. 

On the other hand, I also have great expectations from you:
* Commitment
* Intelligence
* Artisanship
* Results

Here are some pointers depending on the program:

* **Postdoctoral Research Programs**: the bar is higher in terms of originality and leadership. A robust program must include:
    * **Publication about your Vision**, right at the beginning, where you articulate your understanding of the research field and outline a forward-looking vision. *Where is this program taking us?*
    * **Experimentation Plan**, that will lead to *datasets of relevant research data* to subsidize the exploration. *How will we prove it?*
    * **Regular Publications about the Results**, presenting findings from Experiments and analysis of the datasets. *What have we found out so far?*
    * **Support to Grant Application(s)**, opening pathways for independent research and funding.

* **PhD Research Programs**: develop deep expertise and produce original contributions. A good program must include:
    * **Research Proposal**, following the guidelines outlined above. This is a "day 1" thing and we will be revising regularly. 
    * **Regular checkpoints**, where you present what you are thinking, what you have found out so far, and your plan ahead. This is to keep you on track.
    * **Publication about your Vision**,  outlining your understanding  about the vision, challenges, and opportunities. Even if the ideas are preliminary, this will become a key document to support your answer to that tricky question: "what is your research about?"
    * **Regular Publications about the Results**, presenting findings from explorations and experiments. *What have we found out so far?*
    * **Support to Grant Application(s)**, opening pathways for independent research and funding.

* **Master Research Programs**: develop solid research skills while contributing with a meaningful project. A good program must include: 
     * **Program Outline**, including the basic items from the **Research Proposal** outlined above, tailored to what makes sense for this level of research.
    * **Regular checkpoints**, where you present what you are thinking, what you have found out so far, and your plan ahead. This is to keep you on track.
    * **Learning the Right Techniques**, that is *mastering* the tools, methods, or frameworks necessary to explore the problem. 
    * **Publications about the Results**, presenting findings from explorations and experiments. *What have we found out so far?*


## Reap the Rewards

As Iâ€™ll tell you when we first meet in person:
*"There are two moments of true happiness in a research program: when we start it, and when we finish it!"*

In between those two points, youâ€™ll experience many small happinesses: learning a new technique, discovering a better way to do something, getting a paper accepted, or solving a problem that once felt impossible.

Through it all, **always keep a positive attitude**.

When you complete the program, youâ€™ll want to reap the rewards of your time, emotional energy, and financial investment. The way you will reap this reward depends on you, current context and interests:
* A strong sense of personal accomplishment
* Better employment or academic opportunities
* The confidence to pursue entrepreneurship

Whatever your path to happiness may be, make the most of the time and effort youâ€™re putting into the program to ensure it leads you there. Whenever possible, spare some effort to help those around you (including me ðŸ˜Š)

Happiness is only real when shared!
