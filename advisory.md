### AI Leader | Research Professor | Technologist | Startup Advisor 

## My Philosophy on Academic Advisory

Thank you for considering me as your academic advisor.

My role is to help researchers think strategically, publish effectively, innovate meaningfully, and most importantly—conduct research that matters. 
If we focus on real problems, pursue rigorous inquiry, and deliver tangible results, we should be able to create academic success connected to  societal value.

I guide researchers in pursuing work that is meaningful, measurable, and high-impact. The foundation of this approach is simple but powerful: find a problem that matters—both to the world and to you.

## Starting Strong

Every impactful research journey begins with identifying a **intriguing research questions**! This should be a problem that is not only intellectually challenging and personally resonant.

Once you’ve found that problem, the next step is to put a **Research Proposal** outlining:
* Your Intriguing Research Question
* Your argument:
    * Why does this problem exist?
    * What is currently missing in solving it?
    * Why have these gaps remained unaddressed?
    * How will your proposed research contribute toward a solution?
    * Why does your contribution matter?

## Delivering Results

A successful research program should aim to deliver **Scholarly Outcomes** in terms of:
* Peer-reviewed publications.
* A robust and reusable **research framework**.
* Prototypes or technical demonstrations.
* Intellectual Property (patents, disclosures).
* Competitive grant proposals.

Publications should be targeted toward reputable, high-visibility venues, ideally those that contribute to departmental metrics such as [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org)

The **research framework** can take many forms: research tools, experimental setups, documented methodologies, or guidelines for applying your research to real-world use cases.

These deliverables serve as milestones, helping to validate your research, guide your progress, and ensure that your efforts lead to measurable, impactful results.

## Postdoctoral Research Programs

For postdocs, the bar is higher in terms of originality and leadership. A robust postdoc research agenda should include:
* **Vision Paper** that frames research challenges and opportunities in a focused domain.
* **Structured Research Framework**, capable of supporting collaboration and future extensions.
* **Result Paper**, presenting high-quality, peer-reviewed findings.
* **Grant Application(s)**, opening pathways for independent research and funding.

## PhD Research Programs

For PhD students, the goal is to develop deep expertise, produce original contributions to knowledge, and shape the direction of research in a chosen area. A PhD students should be able to
**formulate a significant and novel research question** with clear theoretical or practical impact

Hence, the emphasis is on **advancing knowledge and demonstrating independent research capability**.

I advocate putting together a solid **Research Plan**, following the pointers above (see [Starting Strong](#starting-strong)), and also articulating a plan towards Scholarly Output:

* **Structured Research Framework**, capable of supporting your research project.
* **Positioning Paper** outlining the novel direction or research gap.
* **Results Paper(s)** showcasing key technical or conceptual advancements.
* Contributions to Intellectual Property (patents).
* Strong leads to competitive Grant Proposals.


## Master's Research 

For Master’s program, the goal is to develop solid research skills while contributing to a focused and meaningful project. Students should be able to (i) clearly articulate a research problem and its context, and (ii) apply relevant techniques to investigate or address.

Hence, the emphasis is on learning **how to do research**. 

I suggest putting together a solid **Research Plan**, following the pointers above (see [Starting Strong](#starting-strong)) and then focusing on:
* **Learning the Right Technique**, by building a learning path to master the tools, methods, or frameworks necessary to explore the problem. 

* **Contributing to Scholarly Output**, by outlining a plan on how you can contribute to at least one of the following:   
    * A **positioning paper** outlining the research context, open questions, and proposed direction;
    * A **results paper** presenting experimental findings, validation, or a proof-of-concept.
