I like to build platforms! 
</p>
<p>
Platforms have the power of organization, generating re-usable components to viability and fast-react production. They make us more productive, efficient, and elevate society.  I believe building platforms is about creating connections between software, hardware, and minds -- whether they are software platforms, collaboration hubs, or systems for human-machine interactions. 
</p>
<p>
My overarching research question is: 
</p>
<p>
<i>How can we design platforms that orchestrate human-machine interactions to achieve collective cognition, surpassing the capabilities of individual agents?</i>
</p>
<p>
This question drives my experimentation with systems where humans and machines work together seamlessly, creating outcomes greater than the sum of their parts. I believe these systems are the building blocks of the innovative platforms that will fuel tomorrowâ€™s society.
