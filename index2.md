<h2>How can we design systems for collective cognition?</h2>
</p>
<p>
Dr. Fernando Koch is a <a href="https://www.fau.edu/engineering/directory/faculty/koch/">Research Professor</a> at Florida Atlantic University, where he leads <a href="http://www.generativeintelligencelab.ai">The Generative Intelligence Lab</a>. 
</p>
<p>
He is a recognized expert in Artificial Intelligence and Generative AI, with over three decades of experience spanning academic research and enterprise innovation. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from Utrecht University and has held senior positions at IBM and Samsung Research. He previously held academic appointments at the University of Melbourne and Korea University.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Koch’s work sits at the intersection of Computational Intelligence, Intelligence Platforms, and Human-Machine Collaboration. His work addresses a central question:
</p>
<p>
<i>How can we design systems to improve human-machine interactions and towards collective cognition?</i>
</p>
<p>
This question drives his pursuit of platforms that connect software, automation, and human insight—creating dynamic. Dr. Koch envisions a future where thoughtfully designed systems enhance human capabilities, helping us address complex business and societal challenges.
